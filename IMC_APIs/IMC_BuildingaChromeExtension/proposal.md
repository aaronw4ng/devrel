**TITLE:**    
Building a Chrome Extension: Workshop

**TOPIC:**    
API's/Chrome

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
In this workshop, I plan to give a beginner's guide to chrome extensions. I will introduce the languages one can use for this project and explain why each is useful.  I will also offer a step-by-step walkthrough on how to get the most confusing parts done.  I want to make this workshop interactive so I will build my own chrome extension and walk through how I did it and how you can use it.
